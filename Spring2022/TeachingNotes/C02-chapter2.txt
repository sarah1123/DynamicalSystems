what are your questions about grading in this course?

what questions about the material are on your mind before we start working?


(read up to 8:54am).

Student questions from sections 2.1-2.7

1) Taylor series / linear approximation
- are we only working with analytic functions?
- when will we use them (should I brush up on them)?
- why is linearizing important?  we could use graphical methods / plugging into the function to learn about a particular zero crossing, so what is useful about linearizing?
- is there a quantitative way to analyze the fixed point when f'(x*) == 0? (the case where it could be weakly stable, weakly unstable, or half stable?)
- which terms can be neglected?  why?
- how does linearization relate to Taylor series?
- When we linearize we get exponential growth / decay, but do the deviations frow exponentially fast?
- what is algebraic relaxation vs exponential relaxation?
- are we finding x'' = f'(x*) and checking its value?
- what do we consider a small perturbation (any perturbation that doesn't hit the next fixed point?) vs a larger perturbation?
- why don't we reach a fixed point in finite time?

2) existence and uniqueness
- are fixed points not unique solutions to a first order system?  (SI: we are always going to think of the bucket emptying example...)
- continuity of f(x) and f'(x) are key to existence and uniqueness.  will we have to prove continuity?
- he said something about reaching a point in finite time.  what is the implication / relevance of this?
- when the solution exists, why is it centered around $t = 0$?

3) impossibility of oscillations
- how will this play out as we add more dimensions?
- didn't we see an example of a damped oscillator?  (perhaps you're thinking of the map that we worked with)  Sounds like the student may be thinking $\dot{x} = \sin x$ is an equation for an oscillator...
- just feeling doubtful that oscillation really is impossible (as Cyrus says it would require the vector field at a point be directed in opposite directions at different times)
- what does the vector field being "well-defined" have to do with the impossibility of oscillation.


4) logistic example
- r and $$\dot{x}$$ are both being refered to as growth rates.  These are different, right?

5) position, velocity, acceleration, and the derivative of f(x)
- how does f'(x) relate to acceleration?  (SI: this is a very common error - not sure how to help students avoid it...)

6) half stable
- are all the points we pass through on the way towards a fixed poing half-stable (SI: we will only classify fixed points themselves)


New vocab
monotonic
blow up
half stable
characteristic time scale
phase portrait
stable fixed point
unstable fixed point


Extra notes:
- students get very caught up in the half-stable fixed point (how to identify it analytically, etc).
- remember to introduce hyperbolic vs non-hyperbolic and to share that we care about classifying fixed points as either hyperbolic of non-hyperbolic.  Then if it is hyperbolic we will think about stability.  If it is non-hyperbolic, it is a pretty special, non-generic, fixed point and something something.
